## Features

* **Easy Setup:** Just insert the Errsole code snippet at the beginning of your app's main file. That's it!

* **Automated Log Collection:** Errsole automatically collects all your app logs directly from the Node.js console.

* **Customized Logging:** In contrast to the Node.js console, which categorizes logs as either info or error, Errsole's custom logger provides multiple log levels. This allows for greater precision in logging. Additionally, you can include metadata with your logs and receive alerts for specific log events according to your preferences.

* **Centralized Logging:** Errsole consolidates all your app logs from multiple servers into one centralized database. You can choose your preferred database system.

* **Interactive Web Dashboard:** Easily view, filter, and search your app logs using the Errsole web dashboard.

* **Secure Access Control:** Errsole comes with built-in authentication, ensuring that only you and your authorized development team can access the logs.

* **Error Notifications:**Â Errsole delivers notifications for app crashes and custom alerts directly to your Email or Slack.
